# Ultimate Frisbee Tactics Board
This is a simple web app that I made for a bit of fun. 

This is designed mostly for coaches and players of ultimate frisbee. It is an easy-to-use web app interface to position offensive/defensive players, cones, running paths and the disc on the frisbee field. The field is to scale according to the standard WFDF pitch guidelines (including brick marks).

If you add bugs or feature requests to the issues tab on the GitHub I will try to add or resolve them when I can.
